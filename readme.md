# Acorn

Acorn is a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/)-based content management system (CMS) for creating easy to use, but powerful, websites.

Acorn currently powers <https://maker.tufts.edu> and <https://makernetwork.org>, and includes integration with the [RFID Network](https://github.com/JumbosMakerNetwork/RFID_Network) to make managing a makerspace easier.
