# Maker Network

The Maker Network is a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/)-based community website platform that currently powers <https://maker.tufts.edu>. It includes many of the features that new community makerspaces need, and integrates directly with the [RFID Network](https://github.com/JumbosMakerNetwork/RFID_Network) to make managing a makerspace easier.

## Features

- A maker profile for every user
- Project pages for documentation
- Shared event calendar
- Makerspace equipment handbooks
- Makerspace management tools
- Newsletters and mailing lists
- RFID integration

## License

A [Kirby license](https://getkirby.com/license) is required if you plan to use this site in a production environment. You can purchase one at <https://getkirby.com/buy>

## Installation

One of the many benefits of Kirby is that it doesn't require a database. To install the site, just copy all of the files to your web server's public directory and visit the URL for your website in a browser. Eventually an initial setup wizard will/should be created, but for now you'll need to tweak the site's assets and template files directly.

### Requirements

In addition to [Kirby's requirements](https://getkirby.com/docs/installation/download), your server's Apache settings may also need to be tweaked. Extending the session duration (so that users aren't logged out too frequently) and boosting PHP's allotted RAM are recommended.

## Issues, feedback, and support

This project is currently under active development, and many features are either half-working or broken. Your feedback and/or contributions are appreciated.

If you're a library, school, or community member that would like to adapt this site for your own makerspace - go for it. Unfortunately I can't commit to offering a lot of support, but feel free to shoot an email.
