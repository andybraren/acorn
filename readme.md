# Acorn

[Acorn](https://acorn.blog/) is a content management system (CMS) for creating easy-to-use and highly-capable websites. You can read a bit more about it [here](https://acorn.blog/).

It's currently in a *pre-*pre-alpha state and should not be used for stability & security reasons. It's built on top of the file-based [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) which requires its own [license](https://getkirby.com/buy) if used in production. Kirby's [documentation](https://getkirby.com/docs) is an excellent resource that should make Acorn's structure easier to understand.
